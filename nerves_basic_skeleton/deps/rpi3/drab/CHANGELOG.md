# CHANGELOG

## v0.9.1 jQueryless Modal

`Drab.Modal` is not dependent on `Drab.Modal` anymore, and does not require jQuery to run! You
may now use it out of the box, with standard Phoenix installation. Works with both Bootstrap 3
and 4, while Bootstrap 3 is used by default. In case you want to use Bootstrap 4, configure it with:

```elixir
config :drab, :modal_css, :boostrap4
```

`Drab.Modal` is now loaded by default, as it became the part of Standard Drab Modules.

Also changed the Drab store storage, now it is encrypted, not only signed.

## v0.9.0 BREAKING RELEASE

This release finally introduces the final API. There is no intention to change it, unless very
significant errors are found.

If you are using Drab already, prepare for the changes in the configuration and also in the code.


### `Drab.Live` API changed

As described in #127, API has changed. The most painful change is `Drab.Live.peek`, as it now
returns `{:ok, value}` or `{:error, why}`. Raising `Drab.Live.peek` is for convenience.

`Drab.Live.poke` returns tuple now as well, to catch update errors or disconnections.

### Redesigned `Drab.Config`

Since this version, Drab is no longer configured globally. This means that you may use it in the
multiple endpoints environments.
This requires configuration API change. Most of the Drab options are now located under
the endpoint module:

```elixir
config :drab, MyAppWeb.Endpoint,
  otp_app: :my_app_web,
  ...
```

The endpoint and application name are mandatory.

However, there are still few global options, like `:enable_live_scripts`. Please read
[`Drab.Config`](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Config.html#content) documentation
for more information.

[Do You Want to Know More?](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Config.html)

### More API changes

All functions returning `{:timeout, description}` now return just `{:error, :timeout}`.

### Undeclared handler or shared commander raises

All handlers must now be strictly declared by using `Drab.Commander.defhandler` or
`Drab.Commander.public` macro.

```elixir
defhandler my_handler(socket, payload), do: ..
```

or

```elixir
public :my_handler
def my_handler(socket, payload), do: ...
```

The same is with shared commanders, if you want to use it, declare it with `Drab.Controller`:

```elixir
use Drab.Controller, commanders: [My.Shared.Commander]
```

### Hard depreciations of various functions

* [x] Drab.Client.js/2
* [x] Drab.run_handler()
* [x] Drab.Browser.console!/2
* [x] Drab.Browser.redirect_to!/2
* [x] Drab.Core.broadcast_js!/2

### `drab-event` and `drab-handler` combination no longer exists

The existing syntax `drab-event` and `drab-handler` is removed. Please use the new syntax of:

    <tag drab="event:handler">
    <input drab="focus:input_focus blur:input_blur"
    <input drab-focus="input_focus" drab-blur="input_blur">

[Do You Want to Know More?](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Core.html#module-events)

### Updating from <= v0.8.3

#### `config.exs`

Replace:

```elixir
config :drab, main_phoenix_app: :my_app_web, endpoint: MyAppWeb.Endpoint
```

with:

```elixir
config :drab, MyAppWeb.Endpoint, otp_app: :my_app_web
```

Most of the configuration options now must be placed under the endpoint. Please read
[`Drab.Config`](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Config.html#content) documentation for more info.

## v0.8.3

This version brings two useful features: presence and ability to subscribe to topics in the runtime.

### Upgrading from =< 0.8.2

Please ensure you have set `:main_phoenix_app` in your `config.exs`. The way how Drab is searching
for the Phoenix app it is working on, has been changed.

### Subscribe and unsubscribe from external topics in a runtime

Finally, you are not limited to the compile-time topic you’ve set with `broadcasting/1` macro in the
commander. Now you can `subscribe/2` to the external topic, receiving broadcasts sent to it.

```elixir
subscribe(socket, same_action(MyApp.MyController, :index))
subscribe(socket, same_topic("user_#{user_id}"))
```

### Presence

Conveniences for Phoenix.Presence
If configured (it is disabled by default), tracks the user presence on the topic. The following
example shows the number of connected users, live:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.MyCommander
  use Drab.Commander

  broadcasting "global"
  onconnect :connected
  ondisconnect :disconnected

  def connected(socket) do
    broadcast_html socket, "#number_of_users", Drab.Presence.count_users(socket)
  end

  def disconnected(_store, _session) do
    topic = same_topic("global")
    broadcast_html topic, "#number_of_users", Drab.Presence.count_users(topic)
  end
end
```

By default, presence map key is set as a browser UUID (which is shamelessly stored in the local
store in the browser), but it may be also any session value. This may be useful, if you have the
`user_id` already in the session, just configure it:

```elixir
config :drab, :presence, id: :user_id
```

### Updated enable/disable when processing behaviour

After launching an event from the page, the control (button) is disable until processing stops.
Now it is even better, as it recognizes previously disabled controls (#146).

## v0.8.2

This version is a preparation for v0.9.0, which is going to bring API changes, as described in #127.

* new functions in Drab.Element (#134, #135)
* new `Drab.Coder` for encoding terms to string (#137)
* new `js_socket_constructor` config (#133), useful when using Drab with Webpack
* all assigns are now peekable (#126)
* `broadcast_poke` now gets subject, not only socket (under some limitations) (#141)
* preserve csrf token if `poke` updates the form (fix for #130)

## v0.8.1 - `mix drab.install`

Very important role of Drab is to encourage beginners to try out `Elixir |> Phoenix |> Drab`. The
goal is to have an environment, which is *less scary* than others, like `ruby.rails.ajax`. This
is why all the configuration stuff should be minimized (but with options for power users).

```text
mix drab.install
```

### Bug Fixes

Again, `Drab.Live` engine has been redesigned to solve existing and future issues.

## v0.8.0 - `rm priv/drab.live.cache`

### Potentially breaking release!

`Drab.Live` engine has been redesigned again. No more stupid DETS cache anymore. Drab engine now
creates modules for each template, and stores metadata compiled there.

### Elixir version

Bumped to 1.6, because of the changes in the EEx Engine

### Migration from 0.7.7

    rm priv/drab.live.cache
    mix clean

### Bug fixes

Many. See closed issues!

## v0.7.7
### Potentially breaking release!
As a preparation to 0.8.0, this release contains fundamental change in `Drab.Live` behaviour. It
removes all the engine limitations, and makes a big change on how it treats `@conn` assign.

Please report any found issues with this release.

### API Changes
#### The `@conn` case
Because sometimes it is huge, `@conn` is treated in the special way - it is trimmed to contain only
essential fields. By default it is `:private => :phoenix_endpoint`, but you may configure it.

    config :drab, :live_conn_pass_through, %{
      assigns: %{
        users: true
      },
      private: %{
        phoenix_endpoint: true
      }
    }

See `Drab.Live` documentation for more details on this case.

#### `:templates_path` config must be under `priv/`
If you are using `:templates_path` config, and your templates are not under the `priv/` directory,
you'll have to move them. Solved #105.

## v0.7.6
### New Features
#### Living assigns per process cache
The performance of `poke` and `peek` operations increases significantly, as the event handler
does not have to get the assigns from the browser each time.

#### `broadcast_poke`
You now may broadcast the assign, in exactly the same way you're doing `poke`.

## v0.7.5
### New Features
#### Living assigns inside the shared comamander
If you are using `drab-commander` attribute, the requests coming from the shared commander  updates stuff only under this tag.

    <div drab-commander="DrabTestApp.Shared1Commander">
      <div><%= @assign1 %></div>
      <button drab-click="button_clicked">Shared 1</button>
    </div>
    <div drab-commander="DrabTestApp.Shared1Commander">
      <div><%= @assign1 %></div>
      <button drab-click="button_clicked">Shared 2</button>
    </div>

    defhandler button_clicked(socket, sender) do
      poke socket, assign1: "changed"
    end

This will update only the div with `@assign1` in the same <div drab-commander> as the button.

#### The Great Unification
Callbacks now works in the Shared Commanders.

#### `drab-id` attribute now is generated with the counter, instead of UUID
This means you are now able to use `this/1` and `this_commander/1` with the broadcasting functions.

#### The browser will not reconnect when client library change
Forces user to reload the page in case the Drab JS library is changed.

## v0.7.4
This is a bugfix release.

### Fixed Bugs
#### #97 - 414: url too long when connect
This bug was introduced in 0.7.2, after moving update of assigns cache to the connect token.

#### #94 Jason not found in production
Updated the applications list in `mix.exs`

### New Features
#### Pass options for `Phoenix.Channel`

Set the list of options to pass to `use Phoenix.Channel`. For example, to turn off logging of each `handle_in`:

    config :drab, :phoenix_channel_options, [log_handle_in: false]

## v0.7.3
Fixed the connect issue.

## v0.7.2
### New Features
#### `use Drab.Controller` is now optional
When using default commander name, corresponding to the controller (like PageCommander -> PageController), there is no need to mark controller as `Drab.Controller` anymore.

#### Shared Commanders should be declared in the page controller
All shared commanders must be explicitly declared in the controller:

    use Drab.Controller, commanders: [My.Shared.Commander]

In this version, system generates warning message if commanders are not declared. **This warning will become error in v0.8.0**

#### `defhandler` macro for creating event handlers in commanders
Since this version, all event handlers, whenever they are in shared or "normal" commander, must be declared with `public` or `defhandler` macro. Use `defhandler` instead of the standard `def`.

This:

    public :button_clicked
    def button_clicked(socket, sender), do: ...

is an equivalent of:

    defhandler button_clicked(socket, sender), do: ...

In this version, system generates warning message if the function is not declared as handler. **This warning will become error in v0.8.0**

#### Create Reusable Drab Components with Shared Commanders
Accomplished this with the new `Drab.Core.this_commander/1` function, returning the unique selector of the sourrounding commander tag, so you may easly reduce the region where your update works.

Having the page as below, we want the button to update `.spaceholder1` only within the range of `drab-commander`.

    <div drab-commander="DrabTestApp.Shared1Commander">
      <div class="spaceholder1">Nothing</div>
      <button drab-click="button_clicked">Shared 1</button>
    </div>
    <div drab-commander="DrabTestApp.Shared1Commander">
      <div class="spaceholder1">Nothing</div>
      <button drab-click="button_clicked">Shared 2</button>
    </div>

Just like we can use `Drab.Core.this/1` to select the exact sender of the event, we may have `Drab.Core.this_commander/1`, to build a selector which chooses the desired object:

    defhandler button_clicked(socket, sender) do
      set_prop socket, this_commander(sender) <> " .spaceholder1", innerText: "changed"
    end

Notice the space before “.spaceholder1”. `this_commander/1` returns the string like `[drab-id="f59d54e6-a924-4e72-90d1-5177efecac9b"]`, so you may build any selector based on it.

## v0.7.1
This version is a step forward for creating component-like pieces of code with Drab, with enhanced Shared Commanders and possibility to pass additional argument to the handler function.

Finally, most functions got their own `@spec` and Drab is now dialyzable.

### Warning!
`Drab.Live` cache DETS has changed, please ensure your `"*.drab` templates are recompiled after the upgrade.

### New Features
#### Define Shared Commander with `drab-commander` on all children nodes
If you add `drab-commander` attribute to any tag, all children of this tag will use Shared Commander defined in this tag. Notice it will not redefine nodes, which already has Shared Commander defined.

Thus this:

    <div drab-commander="DrabExample.SharedCommander">
      <button drab-click="button1_clicked">1</button>
      <button drab-click="button2_clicked">1</button>
      <button drab-click="DrabExample.AnotherCommander.button3_clicked">1</button>
    </div>

is equivalent of:

    <div>
      <button drab-click="DrabExample.SharedCommander.button1_clicked">1</button>
      <button drab-click="DrabExample.SharedCommander.button2_clicked">1</button>
      <button drab-click="DrabExample.AnotherCommander.button3_clicked">1</button>
    </div>

#### Additional argument for handlers
Since this version you may create handler with arity of 3, and pass the additional parameter using parenthesis after the handler name in `drab` attribute:

    <button drab-click='button_clicked(42)'>

This will run `button_clicked/3` instead of `button_clicked/2` in your Commander:

    def button_clicked(socket, sender, the_answer_for_the_ultimate_question)

The attribute is evaluated on the client side, so it could be any valid JS expression:

    <button drab-click='button_clicked({the_answer: 42})'>
    <button drab-click='button_clicked(window.location)'>

#### `drab-argument`

Analogically to `drab-commander` attribute, there is a `drab-argument` to set this argument for more nodes. Notice that the existing arguments are not overwritten, so this:

    <div drab-argument='42'>
      <button drab-click='button_clicked'>
      <button drab-click='button_clicked(43)'>
    </div>

is the equivalent to:

    <button drab-click='button_clicked(42)'>
    <button drab-click='button_clicked(43)'>

#### Client-side errors now appears in the application log
For developer happines, all client-side errors are now displayed both on JS console and on the Phoenix side.

Example:

    <button drab=":wrong">

generates:

    [error] Browser reports: Drab attribute value ':wrong' is incorrect.

### Bugfixes
* Parent/child expression case in Drab.Live (#71) solved
* Updated floki to 0.20; fixed #76
* Special case for outerHTML in `Drab.Element.set_prop`, fixed #80
* Special case for HTMLOptionsCollection; fixed #75


## v0.7.0
Updated the Drab core to introduce few important features. Fixed to Elixir version `>= 1.5.2`. Tested with Elixir 1.6.0.

### Possibility to provide own `connect/2` callback for socket authentication, etc
Previously, Drab intercepted the `connect/2` callback in your `UserSocket`. Now, there is a possibility to use your own callback:

    defmodule MyApp.UserSocket do
      use Phoenix.Socket

      channel "__drab:*", Drab.Channel

      def connect(params, socket) do
        Drab.Socket.verify(socket, params)
      end
    end

[Do You Want to Know More?](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Socket.html#module-method-2-use-your-own-connect-2-callback)

### Use of the custom marker "/" in Drab templates
This version allow you to use of `<%/ %>` marker to avoid using `Drab.Live` for a given expression. The expression would be treaten as a normal Phoenix one, so will be displayed in rendered html, but Drab will have no access to it.

```html
<div>
  <%/ @this_assigns_will_be_displayed_but_not_drabbed %>
</div>
```

[Do You Want to Know More?](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Live.html#module-avoiding-using-drab)

### Changed event definition core
The existing syntax `drab-event` and `drab-handler` attributes does not allow having multiple events on the one DOM object (#73). This form is now depreciated and replaces with the brand new, better syntax of:

    <tag drab="event:handler">

Now may set more event on the single object:

    <input drab="focus:input_focus blur:input_blur"

or:

    <input drab-focus="input_focus" drab-blur="input_blur">

[Do You Want to Know More?](https://hexdocs.pm/drab/Drab.Core.html#module-events)

### Event shorthands list is now configurable
By default, you can use only few arbitrary-chosen shorthands for the event name / handler name (`drab-click="clicked"`) attribute. Now you may configure the list with `:events_shorthands` config.
See #73.

### Style changes:
* source code formatted with 1.6.0
* use `@impl true` in behaviour callbacks
* started annotating all functions with `@spec` (so far only few)
* small style improvements suggested by Credo

### Depreciations:
* `Drab.Client.js/2` becomes `Drab.Client.run/2`
* `drab-event` and `drab-handler` attributes combination replaced by `drab`

## v0.6.3
Changes:
* workaround for #71: better docs and error message
* `Drab.Live.poke` returns {:error, description} on error
* improved examples on connect in iex (#72)
* assign list with `Drab.Live.assigns` (#72)


## v0.6.2
Bug fixes:
* live_helper_modules config entry now allows list (#66)
* when updating `value` attribute, `poke` updates property as well (for inputs and textareas)
* changed the order of loaded modules; fixes #69
* changed the way drab is asking for a store and session on connect; probably fixed #68


## v0.6.1
This release fixes new, better bugs introduced in v0.6.0:
* "atom :save_assigns not found" error
* `@conn` case (it was not removing @conn from the initial)
* cache file was deleted after `mix phx.digest`, moved the file to the Drab's priv directory

### Please read documentation for `Drab.Browser`, the API has changed
* cleaned up the mess with API in `Drab.Browser`

## v0.6.0
This is a major release. The biggest change is completely redesigned engine for `Drab.Live` with `nodrab` option. Also introducting **shared commanders**, updates in `Drab.Browser`, performance and bug fixes.

### Migration from 0.5

After installation, please remove all remaining `priv/hashes_expressions.drab.cache.*` files (they were renamed to `drab.live.cache`) and do a mix clean to recompile templates:

````shell
mix clean
````

### Drab.Live
The main change in the new template engine is that now it is not injecting `<span>` everywhere. Now, it parses the html and tries to find the sourrounding tag and mark it with the attribute called `drab-ampere`. The attribute value is a hash of the previous buffer and the expression, so it is considered unique.

Consider the template, with initial value of `1` (given in render function in the Controller, as usual):

````html
<p>Chapter <%= @chapter_no %>.</p>
````
which renders to:

````html
<p drab-ampere="someid">Chapter 1.</p>
````

This `drab-ampere` attribute is injected automatically by `Drab.Live.EExEngine`. Updating the `@chapter_no` assign in the Drab Commander, by using `poke/2`:

````elixir
chapter = peek(socket, :chapter_no)     # get the current value of `@chapter_no`
poke(socket, chapter_no: chapter + 1)   # push the new value to the browser
````

will change the `innerHTML` of the `<p drab-ampere="someid">` to "Chapter 2." by executing the following JS on the browser:

````javascript
document.querySelector('[drab-ampere=someid]').innerHTML = "Chapter 2."
````

This is possible because during the compile phase, Drab stores the `drab-ampere` and the corresponding pattern in the cache DETS file (located in `priv/drab.live.cache`).

#### Sometimes it must add a `<span>`

In case, when Drab can't find the parent tag, it injects `<span>` in the generated html. For example, template
like:

````html
Chapter <%= @chapter_no %>.
````

renders to:

````html
Chapter <span drab-ampere="someid">1</span>.
````

#### Avoiding using Drab (`nodrab` option)
If there is no need to use Drab with some expression, you may mark it with `nodrab/1` function. Such expressions will be treated as a "normal" Phoenix expressions and will not be updatable by `poke/2`.

````html
<p>Chapter <%= nodrab(@chapter_no) %>.</p>
````

In the future (Elixir 1.6 I suppose), the `nodrab` keyword will be replaced by a special EEx mark `/` (expression
will look like `<%/ @chapter_no %>`).

#### The `@conn` case
The `@conn` assign is often used in Phoenix templates. Drab considers it read-only, you can not update it
with `poke/2`. And, because it is often quite hudge, may significantly increase the number of data sent to
the browser. This is why Drab treats all expressions with only one assign, which happen to be `@conn`, as
a `nodrab` assign.

### Shared Commanders
By default Drab runs the event handler in the commander module corresponding to the controller, which rendered the current page. Now it is possible to choose the module by simply provide the full path to the commander:

````html
<button drab-click='MyAppWeb.MyCommander.button_clicked'>clickme</button>
````

Notice that the module must be a commander module, ie. it must be marked with `use Drab.Commander`, and the function must be whitelisted with `Drab.Commander.public/1` macro.

### Changes in `Drab.Browser`
All function in `Drab.Browser` were renamed to their bang version. This is because in the future release functions with and without bang will be more consist with Elixir standards - nobang function will return tuples, bangs will raise on error.

### Warning: functions redirect_to!/2 and console!/2 are changed
In preparation to change all the functions in the module, this functions behavior have changed. Now, they are just bang version of the "normal" function, and **they are not broadcasting anymore**.

You should use `broadcast_redirect_to!/2` and `broadcast_console!/2` instead.


## v0.5.6
Reverted back #51 - `@conn` is available again.

## v0.5.5

### Fixes:
* #20 (broadcasting in Phx 1.3)
* #44 (docs for broadcasting)
* #45 (button inside for submits in Firefox)
* #47 (docs and error message updated)
* #51 (removed @conn from living assigns, encrypts assigns)


## v0.5.4
Fixes for adding templates in a runtime.

```elixir
poke socket, live_partial1: render_to_string("partial1.html", color: "#aaaabb")
poke socket, "partial1.html", color: "red"
```

### Fixes:
* #37
* #40 (updated documentation for Drab.Live.EExEngine)
* #41
* #34 and #38

## v0.5.3
Phoenix 1.3 compatibility
* bugfixes (#19, #36).
* `drab.gen.commander` works both with Phoenix 1.2 and 1.3


## v0.5.2
This is a small update to make Drab compatible with Elixir 1.5.
Due to an issue with 1.5.0 (elixir-lang/elixir#6391) Elixir version is fixed on 1.4 or >= 1.5.1.

### Fixes:
* #26, #27, #30, #31, #33


## v0.5.1
### Fixes:
* Transpiled all JS templates, and removed all occurences of `forEach` (#22)
* Radio buttons not reported correctly in `sender["form"]` (#23)
* New `:main_phoenix_app` config item, in case the app name can't be read from `mix.exs` (#25)

### Changes:
* `sender[:params]` contains params normalized to controller type params (#24)

      %{"_csrf" =>
      "1234", "user[id]" => "42", "user[email]" => "test@test.com",
      "user[account][id]" => "99", "user[account][address][street]" =>
      "123 Any Street"}

    becomes:

      %{"_csrf" => "1234",
      "user" => %{"account" => %{"address" => %{"street" => "123 Any Street"},
      "id" => "99"}, "email" => "test@test.com", "id" => "42"}}

### New features:
* `Core.Browser.set_url/2` to manipulate the browser's URL bar

## v0.5.0
***This version is a major update***. The default module, `Drab.Query` has been replaced with `Drab.Live` and `Drab.Element`. Drab is not jQuery dependent by default anymore.

### `Drab.Live`
Allows to remotely (from the server side) replace the value of the assign in the displayed paged, without re-rendering and reloading the page.

Such template:

```html
<a href="https://<%= @url%>" @style.backgroundColor=<%= @color%>>
  <%= @url %>
</a>
```

can be updates live with `poke/2`:

```elixir
poke socket, url: "tg.pl/drab", color: "red"
```

### `Drab.Element`
Query and update displayed page from the server side.

```elixir
set_prop socket, "p", style: %{"backgroundColor" => "red"} # awesome effect
```

### Broadcasting
Broadcasting functions now get `subject` instead of `socket`. There is no need to have an active socket to broadcast anymore. Useful when broadcasting from background servers or `ondisconnect` callback.

### Form parameters in sender
If the event launching element is inside a `<FORM>`, it gets a values of all input elements within that form. This is a map, where keys are the element's `name` or `id`.

### Upgrading from 0.4
Add `Drab.Query` and `Drab.Modal` to your commanders:

```elixir
use Drab.Commander, module: [Drab.Query, Drab.Modal]
```

### Depreciations
All soft depreciations up to 0.4.1 became hard.

## v0.4.1 - 2017-05-25

### New:
* `render_to_string/2` in Commander, a shorthand for `Phoenix.View.render_to_string/3`

### Internal improvements:
* removed jQuery from core JS code; only Drab.Query and Drab.Modal depends on jQuery
* module dependencies (Drab behaviour)

## 0.4.0
Changes:

* renamed `execjs/2` -> `exec_js/3`, `brodcastjs/2` -> `broadcast_js/3`
* `exec_js/3` returns tuple {:ok, result} or {:error, reason}
* `exec_js!/3` raises exceptions on JS error
* configurable timeouts for `exec_js/3` and `exec_js!/3`


## 0.3.5
Changes:
* Drab.Browser with browser related functions, like local time, timezone difference, userAgent, redirect_to

Depreciations:
* Drab.Core.console moved to Drab.Browser

## 0.3.4 (2017-05-04)

Bug fixes:

* `execute!` allows string as the method with parameters
* reverted back the timeout for `execjs/2` - it caused troubles and it is not really needed; in case of the
  connectivity failure the whole Drab will die anyway

## 0.3.3 (2017-05-03)

* precompile Drab templates for better performance; user templates are still interpreted on the fly
* choose the behaviour for broadcasting functions: now may send to `:same_url`, `:same_controller` or to user
  defined `"topic"`
* timeout for `execjs/2` (and so for the most of Drab.Query functions); default is 5000 ms and can be changed
  with `config :drab, timeout: xxx|:infinity`

## 0.3.2

* phoenix version ~> 1.2 (#13)
* warning when user updates `attr: "data-*"` - it should be done with `data: *` (#14)
* integration tests

## 0.3.1

### New features:

* debugging Drab functions directly from `IEx` console
* display information when handler die, different for prod and dev


## 0.3.0

### API Changes and Depreciations:

* Drab.Query.select API changed: now `select(:val)` returns first value instead of the list, but all jQuery methods
  have corresponding plural methods, which return a Map of `%{name|id|__undefined_XX => value}`

````elixir
# <span name="first_span" class="qs_2 small-border">First span with class qs_2</span>
# <span id="second_span" class="qs_2 small-border">Second span with class qs_2</span>
socket |> select(:html, from: ".qs_2")
# "First span with class qs_2"
socket |> select(:htmls, from: ".qs_2")
# %{"first_span" => "First span with class qs_2", "second_span" => "Second span with class qs_2"}
````

* depreciated `Drab.Endpoint`; Drab now injects in the `UserSocket` with `use Drab.Socket` (#8). Now
  it is possible to share Drab socket with your code (create your channels)

* moved Commander setup to macros instead of use options

````elixir
use Drab.Commander
onload :page_loaded
access_session :userid
````

* renamed JS `launch_event()` to `run_handler()`

### New features:

* `Drab.Waiter` module adds ability to wait for an user response in your function, so you can have a reply
  and continue processing.

````elixir
return = waiter(socket) do
  on "selector1", "event_name1", fn (sender) ->
    # run when this event is triggered on selector1
  end
  on "selector2", "event_name2", fn (sender) ->
    # run when that event is triggered on selector2
  end
  on_timeout 5000, fn ->
    # run after timeout, default: infinity
  end
end
````

* `before_handler` callback (to run before each handler); do not process the even handler if `before_handler`
  returns nil or false

````elixir
before_handler :check_login, except: [:log_in]
def check_login(socket, _dom_sender) do
  get_session(socket, :userid)
end
````

* `after_handler`, getting the return value of handler as an argument

````
after_handler :clean_up
def clean_up(_socket, _dom_sender, handler_return) do
  # some clieanup
end
````

* `Drab.Query.select(:all)` - returns a map of return values of all known jQuery methods

````elixir
socket |> select(:all, from: "span")
%{"first_span" => %{"height" => 16, "html" => "First span with class qs_2", "innerHeight" => 20, ...
````

## 0.2.6
Changes:
* reload drab events in JS after each insert or update
* added event object with specified properties to the dom_sender
* added `debounce` function as an option to the event handler
* renamed Drab.Config to Drab.Commander.Config

## 0.2.5
Changes:
* handling disconnects (ondisconnect callback)
* keep Store in a permament location (browser store) on demand
* access to Plug Session with `Drab.Core.get_session/2`

## 0.2.4
Fixed:
* not working in IE11 (#5)

## 0.2.3
Fixed:
* not working on iOS9 (#3): changed all ES6 constructs to plain JS

## 0.2.2
New callbacks and Session housekeeping (renamed to Store)

Changes:
* new callback: onconnect
* renamed Session to Store to avoid confusion

## 0.2.1
Introduced Drab Session: the way to access (read-only) the Plug Session map in the Commander.

Changes:
* `use Drab.Endpoint` instead of `socket Drab.config.socket, Drab.Socket` in endpoint.ex
* Drab Session with value inheritance from the Plug Session
* event handler must return socket, warning in the other case

Fixes:
* security (#2): checks token in each event call to prevent tampering


## 0.2.0 (2017-01-22)
This version cames with refactored modules and client JS library. It is now modular, so you don't need
to use jQuery and DOM if you don't have to.

Changes:
* extracted Drab core; split the JS templates between modules
* jQuery not required in Drab.Core
* moved Drab.Query.execjs and broadcastjs to Drab.Core.execjs and broadcastjs
* moved Drab.Call.console to Drab.Core.console (and console!)
* renamed Drab.Call to Drab.Modal
* renamed Drab.Templates to Drab.Template
* JS: Drab is global, Drab.launch_event() is available


## 0.1.1

Changes:
* added more jQuery methods, like width, position, etc
* cycling
    update(:text, set: ["One", "Two", "Three"], on: "#thebutton")
    update(:class, set: ["btn-success", "btn-danger"], on: "#save_button")
* toggling class
    update(:class, toggle: "btn-success", on: "#btn")

Fixes:
* atom leaking issue (#1)


## 0.1.0
First public version. Very shy.
